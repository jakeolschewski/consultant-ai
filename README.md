## Why consultant-ai?

- **MCP is the hottest protocol in AI right now.** Every major AI client supports it. consultant-ai is the first MCP server built specifically for consultants.
- **Solo consultants are the fastest-growing AI adopters.** This gives them enterprise-grade operations without enterprise overhead.
- **Built by consultants, for consultants.** Every tool is based on real consulting workflows, not generic templates.

## The WEDGE Framework

consultant-ai is built on the WEDGE prompt methodology — a 5-part structure for getting expert-level outputs from AI tools:

**W**ho — Define the AI's role  
**E**stablish context — Your specific situation  
**D**efine deliverable — Exactly what to produce  
**G**uide constraints — Quality rules and format  
**E**valuate — Self-check before responding  

All 8 prompt templates in consultant-ai use WEDGE. Access the full guide at `consultant-ai://knowledge/wedge-framework-guide` in your AI client, or visit [thewedgemethodai.com](https://thewedgemethodai.com).
